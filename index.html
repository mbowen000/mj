			<p>
				Julia and Mike were introduced by their friends Brad and Jillian, who thought they'd be a perfect match. After an initial (seven month) hesitation, Julia agreed to have dinner with Jillian, Brad and Mike. She was pleasantly surprised by how much she enjoyed Mike’s company and they soon found themselves sitting across from one another on both the best and last first date they’d ever had. While Mike enjoyed the impressive toning of Julia’s yoga arms and asked questions about her recent trip to Thailand, Julia couldn’t believe how easy it was to talk to Mike. Their first date quickly lead to their first Julia-as-the-teacher, Mike-as-the-student yoga class. After that, they got hooked. Julia and Mike have spent the past two and half years exploring Chicago and the beauties of nature across the country side by side. On her 30th birthday, Mike took Julia to one of her favorite parks on the lake, got down on one knee and asked her to spend the rest of her life with him. This time, there was no hesitation, Julia said YES! Now we get to celebrate!

			<p>Since our wedding is happening along with the 4th of July weekend, prices might be a little higher than normal,
				but we hope you can find something that works. Here are some tips:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The <b><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels+Near+Chicago+Loop/@41.8809764,-87.6323908,16z/data=!3m1!4b1" target="_blank">downtown loop area</a></b> doesn't have the lowest prices, but if you're looking to do some sight-seeing then it would be
					very convenient to stay here. Recommendations include:
					<uL>
						<li><a href="http://www.centralloophotel.com/directions/" target="_blank">Club Quarters Hotel - Central Loop</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://chicagorivernorth.place.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html">Hyatt Place River North</a></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					If you're looking to save some money or are looking to make a quick escape, the hotels near <b><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels+Near+Ohare/@41.9775657,-87.9215482,14z/data=!3m1!4b1" target="_blank">O'hare International Airport</a></b>
					have some lower prices. Another option is to stay north of the city in Evanston, which is about a 30 minute ride from our venue, but will save 
					money on both rooms and parking.

					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://chicagoevanston.house.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html">Hyatt House Evanston/Chicago</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/illinois/hampton-inn-and-suites-rosemont-chicago-ohare-CHIRSHX/index.html">Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Rosemont Chicago O'hare</a></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Chicago--IL?neighborhoods%5B%5D=Roscoe%20Village&page=1&s_tag=jexpqDoH&allow_override%5B%5D=" target="_blank">Airbnb</a></b> is widely available throughout the city and can save some serious money and provide an experience that is 
					usually pretty awesome. Try finding a place near Roscoe Village, West Lakeview, or Lincoln Square and you'll be in a
					really cool neighborhood. Pro-tip: Get a house with a bunch of friends and split the cost!
