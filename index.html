			<p>
				Julia and Mike were introduced by their friends Brad And Jillian who thought they'd be a perfect match.
				Turns out, they were right! After hitting it off on numerous dates around Chicago's north side for the next couple years,
				Mike asked Julia to marry him and it worked! So lets get together and celebrate!

			<p>Since our wedding is happening along with the 4th of July weekend, prices might be a little higher than normal,
				but we hope you can find something that works. Here are some tips:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The <b><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels+Near+Chicago+Loop/@41.8809764,-87.6323908,16z/data=!3m1!4b1" target="_blank">downtown loop area</a></b> doesn't have the lowest prices, but if you're looking to do some sight-seeing then it would be
					very convenient to stay here. Recommendations include:
					<uL>
						<li>Central Loop Hotel</li>
						<li>Hyatt Place River North</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					If you're looking to save some money or are looking to make a quick escape, the hotels near <b><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels+Near+Ohare/@41.9775657,-87.9215482,14z/data=!3m1!4b1" target="_blank">O'hare International Airport</a></b>
					have some lower prices.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Chicago--IL?neighborhoods%5B%5D=Roscoe%20Village&page=1&s_tag=jexpqDoH&allow_override%5B%5D=" target="_blank">Airbnb</a></b> is widely available throughout the city and can save some serious money and provide an experience that is 
					usually pretty awesome. Try finding a place near Roscoe Village, West Lakeview, or Lincoln Square and you'll be in a
					really cool neighborhood. Pro-tip: Get a house with a bunch of friends and split the cost!				
				</li>
